# Bitcoin Privacy

Through my interaction with cryptocurrency users I have discovered that quite a number of users do not understand the degree of privacy (or lack there of) that a blockchain based currency (such as bitcoin) affords or offers.   
There is a large body of research pointing out the shortcomings of privacy in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but somehow that knowledge does not make it into the mainstream of cryptocurrency users.    
I would like to contribute (and I challenge others as well) to bring to the attention of cryptocurrency users best practices of using cryptocurrency while keeping maximum privacy available.
